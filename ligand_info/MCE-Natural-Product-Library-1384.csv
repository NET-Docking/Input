Target:
SB365 effectively inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells. Its apoptotic effect was accompanied by increased evidence of cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase. To elucidate the anticancer mechanism of SB365, we used an array of 42 different receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Of the 42 different phospho-RTKs, SB365 strongly inhibited expression of activated c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) in gastric cancer cells [1]. SB365 strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of 5 human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIAPaCa-2, BXPC-3, PANC-1, AsPC-1 and HPAC). The apoptotic effect of SB365 was demonstrated by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 expression via mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as elevated numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic cells [2]. SB365 strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of colon cancer cells and induced their apoptosis. Also, SB365 showed anti-angiogenic activity by decreasing the expression of HIF-1¦Á and VEGF.

in vitro: dioscin (1, 2 and 4 ¦Ìmol/L) could significantly inhibit the viability of LNCaP cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry revealed that the apoptosis rate was increased after treatment of LNCaP cells with dioscin for 24 h, indicating that apoptosis was an important mechanism by which dioscin inhibited cancer [1]. dioscin abrogated AKT phosphorylation, which subsequently impaired RANKL-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-¦ÊB) signaling pathway and inhibited NFATc1 transcriptional activity. Moreover, in vivo studies further verified the bone protection activity of dioscin in osteolytic animal model [2]. Dioscin reduced cell death and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in cells subjected to I/R.

Furosemide (INN/BAN) or frusemide is a loop diuretic used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and edema. It is most commonly marketed by Sanofi under the brand name Lasix, and also under the brand names Fusid and Frumex. It has also been used to prevent Thoroughbred and Standardbred race horses from bleeding through the nose during races.Along with some other diuretics, furosemide is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned drug list due to its alleged use as a masking agent for other drugs.
Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting NKCC2, the luminal Na-K-2Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The action on the distal tubules is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance.Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, as it is with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Additionally, furosemide is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors. Furosemide has been reported to reversibly antagonize GABA-evoked currents of ¦Á6¦Â2¦Ã2 receptors at uM concentrations, but not ¦Á1¦Â2¦Ã2 receptors.

Adenosine plays an important role in biochemical processes, such as energy transfer ¡ª as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ¡ª as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP. It is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter, believed to play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal. Adenosine also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation.
Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes. Extracellular adenosine concentrations from normal cells are approximately 300 nM; however, in response to cellular damage (e.g. in inflammatory or ischemic tissue), these concentrations are quickly elevated (600¨C1,200 nM). Thus, in regard to stress or injury, the function of adenosine is primarily that of cytoprotection preventing tissue damage during instances of hypoxia, ischemia, and seizure activity.

Metronidazole is an antibiotic, amebicide, and antiprotozoal.[1] It is the drug of choice for first episodes of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile infection [2]. Metronidazole, taken up by diffusion, is selectively absorbed by anaerobic bacteria and sensitive protozoa. Once taken up by anaerobes, it is non-enzymatically reduced by reacting with reduced ferredoxin, which is generated by pyruvate oxido-reductase. Many of the reduced nitroso intermediates will form sulfinamides and thioether linkages with cysteine-bearing enzymes, thereby deactivating these critical enzymes. As many as 150 separate enzymes are affected.In addition or alternatively, the metronidazole metabolites are taken up into bacterial DNA, and form unstable molecules. This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic cells, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria.[3]",Free Base,OCCN1C([N+]([O-])=O)=CN=C1C,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Metronidazole.html

Target: RAR/RXR
Acitretin is a second-generation, systemic retinoid that has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis since 1997. It can be considered one of the treatments of choice for pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis. However, the efficacy of acitretin as a monotherapy for plaque psoriasis is less, although it is often used in combination therapy with other systemic psoriasis therapies, especially ultraviolet B or psoralen plus ultraviolet A phototherapy, to increase efficacy. Such combination treatments may potentially minimise toxicity by using lower doses of each of the two agent [1].
Thirty-nine male adult Wistar albino rats were divided into 3 groups as two experimental groups and one control group. The first group consisting 14 rats were applied orally standard dose (0.75 mg/kg/day) acitretin and the second group consisting 16 rats were applied high dose (1.5 mg/kg/day) acitretin.Acitretin was given within dimetil sulphoxide (DMSO), which was diluted with saline solution as a ratio of 1/10, in order to increase its solubility. The control group consisting 9 rats were given only saline solution including DMSO for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of the administration, half of the rats in the first and second groups and the entire control group were sacrificed under deep ether anaesthesia and bilateral orchiectomy was made. The remainingrats were compared with the control group using a similar method at the end of 8 weeks of wash-off period. The orchiectomy materials were histopathologically evaluated under the light microscope for spermatogenesis according to parameters including spermatogenetic activity, spermatogenetic organization, seminiferous tubular diameter, interstitial Leydig cells and fibroblasts.  In our study it was concluded that the standard and high doses of acitretin do not have any effect on the spermatogenesis of threats [2].

Cysteamine has been shown to increase intracellular glutathione levels in cystinotic cells, thus restoring the altered redox state of the cells. Also increased rates of apoptosis in cystinotic cells, which are thought to be the result of increased caspase 3 and protein kinase C¦Å activity, is counteracted by Cysteamine administration. Cysteamine has antioxidant properties as a result of increasing glutathione production. Cysteamine is an excellent scavenger of OH and HOCl; it also reacts with H2O2. Cysteamine increases the production of several heat shock proteins (HSP), including the murine Hsp40. Cysteamine exerts a dose-dependent effect on the doxorubicin-induced death of cancer cells, measured in both HeLa cells and B16 cells, whereas Cysteamine treatment alone had no influence on cell survival. In addition, in a doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell line, the addition of Cysteamine to doxorubicin results in a dramatic increase in cell death [1].

Imidazole is useful as a buffer in the pH range of 6.2-7.8 One of the applications of imidazole is in the purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography(IMAC). Imidazole is used to elute tagged proteins bound to Ni ions attached to the surface of beads in the chromatography column. An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel co-ordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins. Imidazole has become an important part of many pharmaceuticals. Synthetic imidazoles are present in many fungicides and antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antihypertensive medications.

Arecoline hydrobromide (10 microM) abolished the arecoline (80 nM)--induced contraction.

Pefloxacin is a synthetic chemotherapeutic agent used to treat severe and life-threatening bacterial infections. Pefloxacin is commonly referred to as afluoroquinolone (or quinolone) drug and is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterials. It is an analog of norfloxacin. It is a synthetic fluoroquinolone, belonging to the 3rd generation of quinolones. Pefloxacin is extensively prescribed in France. Pefloxacin has not been approved for use in the United States.
The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing.

Target: 5-HT Receptor
In vitro: In the present study we have showed that pre-treatment with Ferulic Acid (FA) reduces NO accumulation in the culture medium of LPS-induced macrophage cells. Moreover, real-time experiments have revealed that FA has an inhibitory effect at the transcriptional level on the expression of some inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNF-¦Á and iNOS and an activation effect on the expression of some antioxidant molecules such as Metallothioneins (MT-1, MT-2). Importantly, we have found that FA reduced the translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear transcription factor-¦ÊB (NF-¦ÊB) into the nuclei through a reduction of the expression of phosphorylated IKK and consequently inhibited IL-6 and NF-¦ÊB promoter activity in a luciferase assay [1]. FA treatment significantly, although not completely, protected the cells against lead acetate-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition. The effects of FA could be blocked by PD98059, zinc protoporphyrin (Zn-PP), and Nrf2 shRNA. In addition, FA induced heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) gene expression, enhanced antioxidant response element (ARE) promoter activity, promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and Nrf2 translocation in PC12 cells exposed to lead acetate. ERK1/2 locate upstream of Nrf2 and regulate Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression in antioxidative effects of FA [2].

Target: Nucleoside antimetabolite/analog
Cytidine is a nucleoside molecule that is formed when cytosine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a ¦Â-N1-glycosidic bond. Cytidine is a component of RNA. If cytosine is attached to a deoxyribose ring, it is known as a deoxycytidine. Dietary sources of cytidine include foods with high RNA (ribonucleic acid) content, such as organ meats, Brewer's yeast, as well as pyrimidine-rich foods such as beer. During digestion, RNA-rich foods are broken-down into ribosyl pyrimidines (cytidine and uridine), which are absorbed intact. In humans, dietary cytidine is converted into uridine, which is probably the compound behind cytidine's metabolic effects.
There are a variety of cytidine analogs with potentially useful pharmacology. For example, KP-1461 is an anti-HIV agent that works as a viral mutagen, and zebularine exists in E. coli and is being examined for chemotherapy.

in vitro: Astragalin nontoxic at ¡Ü 20 ¦ÌM suppressed cellular induction of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and ROS production enhanced by LPS.

H2O2 and LPS promoted epithelial apoptosis concomitant with nuclear condensation or caspase-3 activation, which was blunted by astragalin [1].  astragalin suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor ¦Á, interleukin 6, and nitric oxide in a dose-dependent manner in mMECs [2]. astragalin attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-¦Á (TNF-¦Á), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1¦Â (IL-1¦Â) in a dose-dependent manner.

in vitro: Costunolide significantly inhibited RANKL-induced BMM differentiation into osteoclasts in a dose-dependent manner without affecting cytotoxicity. Costunolide did not regulate the early signaling pathways of RANKL, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-¦ÊB pathways. However, costunolide suppressed nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) expression via inhibition of c-Fos transcriptional activity without affecting RANKL-induced c-Fos expression. The inhibitory effects ofcostunolide were rescued by overexpression of constitutively active (CA)-NFATc1 [1]. Exposure of T24 cells to costunolide was also associated with increased expression of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin and significant activation of caspase-3, and its downstream target PARP [2]. Both costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone inhibited cell viability dose- and time-dependently. IC50 values ranged from 6.2 ug/mL to 9.8 ug/mL. Cells treated with costunolide showed no changes in cell cycle, little in caspase 3/7 activity, and low levels of cleaved caspase-3 after 24 and 48 h [3].

IC50 value: 4.1 uM [1]
Target: XIAP
in vitro: Embelin induced activation of caspase-9 and embelin-induced apoptosis was prevented by caspase inhibitors [2]. Treatment with subtoxic doses of Embelin broadly sensitized malignant glioma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Notably, human astrocytes were not significantly affected by the combined treatment consisting of Embelin and TRAIL. Combined treatment with Embelin and TRAIL augmented the activation of initiator caspases-8/-9 and effector caspases-3/-7, respectively [3]. 
in vivo:  Embelin inhibited topical edema in the mouse ear, leading to substantial reductions in skin thickness and tissue weight, inflammatory cytokine production, neutrophil-mediated myeloperoxidase activity, and various histopathological indicators. Furthermore, embelin was effective at reducing inflammatory damage induced by chronic TPA exposure [4]. Embelin (10, 30 or 50mg/kg body weight) was administrated daily per oral route for 7days. Embelin significantly attenuated DSS-induced DAI scores and tissue MPO accumulation, which implied that it suppressed weight loss, diarrhea, gross bleeding, and the infiltrations of immune cells.

Target: Antibacterial
Tylosin tartrate is a bacteriostat food additive used in veterinary medicine. It has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms and a limited range of gram-negative organisms. There is no significant evidence that tylosin resistant staphylococci of animal origin have endangered human health. 
Tylosin tartrate is not effective against the gram-negative intestinal flora, which thus does not lead to selection of R-factors by conjugation. 
From the human medical stand point, there is no reason that precludes the use of tylosin as a fee additive in animal feeds [1]. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for tylosin tartrate and other commonly used antibiotics were determined for 103 isolates. Most (82.61%) of the isolates not exposed to antibiotics in the 3 months before submission were sensitive to tylosin tartrate.

Target: Others
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis (especially odd chain fatty acids) and energy production. 
Vitamin B12 normally plays a significant role in the metabolism of every cell of the body, especially affecting the DNA synthesis and regulation but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production. However, many (though not all) of the effects of functions of B12 can be replaced by sufficient quantities of folic acid (vitamin B9), since B12 is used to regenerate folate in the body. Most vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms are actually folate deficiency symptoms, since they include all the effects of pernicious anemia and megaloblastosis, which are due to poor synthesis of DNA when the body does not have a proper supply of folic acid for the production of thymine due to methyl trapping. When sufficient folic acid is available, all known B12 related deficiency syndromes normalize, save those narrowly connected with the vitamin B12-dependent enzymes Methylmalonyl Coenzyme A mutase, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), also known as methionine synthase; and the buildup of their respective substrates (methylmalonic acid, MMA) and homocysteine.Coenzyme B12's reactive C-Co bond participates in three main types of enzyme-catalyzed reactions [1, 2].",Free Base,N#[C-][Co+3]123([N]4=CN(C(OC(CO)C5OP6([O-])=O)C5O)C7=C4C=C(C)C(C)=C7)[N]8=C9C(CCC(N)=O)C(CC(N)=O)(C)C8(C)C(C(CC(N)=O)C%10(CCC(NCC(C)O6)=O)C)[N-]1C%10=C(C)C(C(CCC(N)=O)C%11(C)C)=[N]2C%11=CC%12=[N]3C(C(CC(N)=O)(C)C%12CCC(N)=O)=C9C,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Vitamin-B12.html

Target: Dopamine Receptor; Adrenergic Receptor
Octopamine is present in relatively high concentrations in neuronal as well as in non-neuronal tissues of most invertebrate species studied, and modulates almost every physiological process. Octopamine acts as neurohormone including desensitization of sensory inputs, influence on learning and memory, or regulation of the mood of the animal in the central nervous system. Octopamine is the only neuroactive non-peptide transmitter whose physiological role is restricted to invertebrates, and all octopamine receptors belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors [1].
Octopamine (10 ¦ÌM) injected into the mushroom body (MB) calyces or the antennal lobe but not the lateral protocerebral lobe produces a lasting, pairing-specific enhancement of extension of the proboscis. Octopamine (10 ¦ÌM) injected into the MB calyces results in an additional pairing-specific effect, because it does not lead to an acquisition but a consolidation after conditioning [2]. Octopamine treatment significantly elevates levels of octopamine in the brain and caused a significant dose-dependent increase in the number of new foragers. Octopamine treatment is effective only when given to bees old enough to forage, i.e., older than 4 days of age.

IC50 value:
Target: Anticancer natural compound
in vitro: TBMS I inhibited the proliferation of both HepG2 and L-02 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but HepG2 cells appeared more sensitive to the agent. When exposed to TBMS I for 24, 48 and 72 h, IC50 for HepG2 cells versus L-02 cells were 15.5 vs. 23.1, 11.7 vs. 16.2, 9.2 vs. 13.1 (¦ÌM, p<0.01), respectively. TBMS I induced cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, mitochondrial membrane disruption, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, activation of caspase 3 and 9, and shifting Bax/Bcl-2 ratio from being anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic, all indicative of initiation and progression of apoptosis involving mitochondrial dysfunction [1]. TBMS1-induced molecular events were related to mitochondria-induced intrinsic apoptosis and P21-cyclin B1/cdc2 complex-related G2/M cell cycle arrest [2]. TBMS1 combined with CDDP promoted cell apoptosis, decreased proliferation activity and increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Bcl-2 protein expression was down-regulated but Bax was up-regulated. Moreover, GST-¦Ð mRNA and protein expression were decreased. TBMS1 reduced the resistance of the cells to CDDP-induced cytotoxicity [4]. Treatment with TBMS1 resulted in dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation, led to arrest in phase G2/M of the cell cycle and increased the levels of intracellular Ca2 . Furthermore, TBMS1 up-regulated the levels of the glucose-regulated protein 78/immunoglobuin heavy chain binding protein (GRP78/Bip), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 and down-regulated the levels of Bcl-2 [5].
in vivo: TBMS1 significantly inhibited the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-¦Á, IL-6 and IL-1¦Â in vitro and in vivo.

Target: Antibacterial
Nalidixic acid is the first of the synthetic quinolone antibiotics. Nalidixic acid is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In lower concentrations, it acts in a bacteriostatic manner; that is, it inhibits growth and reproduction. In higher concentrations, it is bactericidal, meaning that it kills bacteria instead of merely inhibiting their growth. Nalidixic selectively and reversibly blocks DNA replication in susceptible bacteria. Nalidixic acid and related antibiotics inhibit a subunit of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and induce formation of cleavage complexes. It also inhibits the nicking-closing activity on the subunit of DNA gyrase that releases the positive binding stress on the supercoiled DNA.

Target: anticancer natural compound
in vitro: Cucurbitacin-B inhibited growth and modulated expression of cell-cycle regulators in SHSY5Y cells. At the molecular level, we found that Cucurbitacin-B inhibited AKT signaling activation through up-regulation of PTEN [1]. CuB induced apoptosis of A549 cells in a -concentration-dependent manner, as determined by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. CuB dose-dependently inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation, with cell cycle inhibition and cyclin B1 downregulation. Apoptosis induced by CuB was shown to be associated with cytochrome c release, B-cell lymphoma 2 downregulation and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway inhibition [2]. CuB inhibited ITGA6 and ITGB4 (integrin ¦Á6 and integrin ¦Â4), which are overexpressed in breast cancer. Furthermore, CuB also induced the expression of major ITGB1and ITGB3, which are known to cause integrin-mediated cell death [3]. Cuc B treatment caused DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) without affecting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the potential molecular target for Cuc B. Cuc B triggers ATM-activated Chk1-Cdc25C-Cdk1, which could be reversed by both ATM siRNA and Chk1 siRNA. Cuc B also triggers ATM-activated p53-14-3-3-¦Ò pathways, which could be reversed by ATM siRNA [4].
in vivo: Efficacy of CuB was tested in vivo using two different orthotopic models of breast cancer. MDA-MB-231 and 4T-1 cells were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pad of female athymic nude mice or BALB/c mice respectively. Our results showed that CuB administration inhibited MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumors by 55%, and 4T-1 tumors by 40%.

In vitro: The in vitro study of resveratrol and trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol showed rather weak cytotoxic effects on three cancer cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231), which contradicted a previous study reporting that resveratrol inhibited MCF-7 cells with an IC50 of about 10 ¦ÌM. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the measurements were made 24 h after drug treatment, whereas the measurements of the previous study were taken 6 days after. The fact that the cytotoxic effect of trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol was lower than that of resveratrol is surprising, because in many studies, trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol is the most active analogue of resveratrol , although resveratrol shows much stronger antioxidant effects than that of trans-Trimethoxyresveratrol.[1]

Biotin is necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. It plays a role in the citric acid cycle, which is the process by which biochemical energy is generated during aerobic respiration. Biotin is a coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes, involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, isoleucine, and valine, and in gluconeogenesis. In addition, biotin is widely used throughout the biotechnology industry to conjugate proteins for biochemical assays. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be 35 to 70 microg/d (143-287 nmol/d). Recent studies suggest that humans absorb biotin nearly completely. Conditions that may increase biotin requirements in humans include pregnancy, lactation, and therapy with anticonvulsants or lipoic acid [1, 2].",Free Acid,O=C(O)CCCC[C@@H]1SC[C@]([C@]1([H])N2)([H])NC2=O,https://www.medchemexpress.com/biotin.html

A very similar Km value was obtained in hPEPT1/CHO cells and in rat and rabbit tissues and Caco-2 cells, suggesting that hPEPT1 dominates the intestinal transport properties of VACV in vitro . 
For treatment of a first episode of genital herpes, a large comparative trial has shown that valacyclovir (1 g twice a day) is as effective as acyclovir (200 mg five times a day) when given for 10 days. For treating recurrences, two trials show that valacyclovir is as effective as acyclovir (200 mg five times a day) with a treatment period of 5 days. A daily dose of 1 g of valacyclovir is as effective as 2 g daily. Valacyclovir can be administered once a day. The concentrations of acyclovir in serum and CSF were measured at steady state after 6 days of oral treatment with 1,000 mg of valacyclovir three times a day. EC50 values of PE and AC in 3T3 cells were 0.02 and 0.01 ug/ml, while values in BHK cells were 0.2 and 0.03 ug/ml.

As a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin, it is used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, in particular, species of staphylococci that are resistant to other penicillins. Nafcillin is considered therapeutically equivalent to oxacillin, although its safety profile is somewhat different. Nafcillin was shown to reversibly inhibit beta-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus PC1 with characteristics indicative of a type A inhibitor [Citri, Samuni & Zyk (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73, 1048-1052]. At nafcillin concentrations above 80 mM, complete inactivation occurred within 200 s. Upon removal of the excess nafcillin the inhibited enzyme was re-activated completely, with a rate constant of 2.0 x 10(-3) s-1 (25 degrees C) [1, 2].",Sodium,[O-]C([C@@H]1N(C2=O)[C@]([C@@H]2NC(C(C3=CC=CC=C3C=C4)=C4OCC)=O)([H])SC1(C)C)=O.[Na+].O,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Nafcillin-sodium-monohydrate.html

Target: antifungal
in vitro: Itraconazole is pharmacologically distinct from other azole antifungal agents in that it is the only inhibitor in this class that has been shown to inhibit both the hedgehog signaling pathway and angiogenesis[1, 2]. These distinct activities are unrelated to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase and the exact molecular targets responsible remain unidentified. Functionally, the antiangiogenic activity of itraconazole has been shown to be linked to inhibition of glycosylation, VEGFR2 phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways [2].Evidence suggests the structural determinants for inhibition of hedgehog signaling by itraconazole are recognizably different from those associated with antiangiogenic activity [3].
in vivo: Nine volunteers were given either 200 mg itraconazole, or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days. On day 4, itraconazole increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve from 10 to 15 times (p < 0.001) and mean peak concentrations three to four times (p < 0.001) compared with the placebo phase.

Target: H1 receptor
Mianserin is a psychoactive drug of the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) therapeutic family. It is classified as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) and has antidepressant, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), hypnotic (sedating), antiemetic (nausea and vomiting-attenuating), orexigenic (appetite-stimulating), and antihistamine effects. It is not approved for use in the US, but its analogue, mirtazapine, is. Mianserin was the first antidepressant to reach the UK market that was less dangerous than the tricyclic antidepressants in overdose.
Mianserin is an antagonist/inverse agonist of the H1, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, ¦Á1-adrenergic, and ¦Á2-adrenergic receptors, and also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine. As a high affinity H1 receptor inverse agonist, mianserin has strong antihistamine effects (sedation, weight gain, etc.). Contrarily, it has negligible affinity for the mACh receptors, and thus lacks any anticholinergic properties. It was recently found to be a potent kappa opioid receptor agonist. In addition, mianserin also appears to be a potent antagonist of the neuronal octopamine receptor. What implications this may have on mood are currently unknown, however octopamine has been implicated in the regulation of sleep, appetite and insulin production and therefore may theoretically contribute to the overall side effect profile of mianserin.",Hydrochloride,CN(CC1)CC2N1C3=CC=CC=C3CC4=CC=CC=C24.Cl,https://www.medchemexpress.com/mianserin-hydrochloride.html

Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat pharyngitis, tonsillitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia (especially atypical pneumonias associated with Chlamydophila pneumoniae), skin and skin structure infections. Clarithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome and thus inhibits the translation of peptides. Clarithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Legionella pneumophila. Besides this bacteriostatic effect, clarithromycin also has bactericidal effect on certain strains, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Clarithromycin is a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Even low doses of the cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor clarithromycin increase the plasma concentrations and effects of repaglinide.

Although this use is widespread in the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved albendazole for this indication. It is marketed by Amedra Pharmaceuticals. Albendazole was first discovered at the SmithKline Animal Health Laboratories in 1972. It is a broad spectrum anthelmintic, effective against roundworms, tapeworms, and flukes of domestic animals and humans.
Albendazole has been used as an anthelmintic and for control of flukes in a variety of animal species, including cattle, sheep, goats, swine, camels, dogs, cats, elephants, poultry and others. In many countries, it is very commonly used for ruminant livestock. For use in livestock, albendazole is marketed by Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health) in numerous countries (including the United States and Canada) as Valbazen in oral suspension and paste formulations; by Interchemie in the Netherlands and elsewhere as Albenol-100; by Channelle Animal Health Ltd. in the United Kingdom as Albex; by Ravensdown in New Zealand as Albendazole; etc. Although most formulations are administered orally, Ricomax (ricobendazole, or albendazole sulfoxide) is administered by subcutaneous injection.",Free Base,O=C(OC)NC1=NC2=CC=C(SCCC)C=C2N1,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Albendazole.html

The antimycotic drug clotrimazole inhibits the function of the gastric H,K-ATPase in a manner similar to that observed for the Na,K-ATPase. Because of the high hydrophobicity of the compound, the interaction between clotrimazole and the ion pump occurs at the membrane domain in the apolar core of the membrane.

IC50 value:
Target: apoptosis inducer
in vitro: Meisoindigo inhibited the growth of leukemic cells by inducing marked apoptosis and moderate cell-cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase. It down-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, and up-regulated pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax and cell-cycle related proteins, p21and p27. Furthermore, it induced myeloid differentiation, as demonstrated by morphologic changes, up-regulation of CD11b, and increased nitroblue tetrazolium reduction activity in all cell lines tested. In addition, meisoindigo down-regulated the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and enhanced the cytotoxicity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, cytarabine and idarubicin. As with the results from cell lines, meisoindigo also induced apoptosis, up-regulated p21 and p27, and down-regulated Bcl-2 in primary AML cells [1]. meisoindigo effectively inhibits HT-29 cell proliferation (IC(50) 4.3 mmol/L), arrests HT-29 cells in G2/ M phase and induces HT-29 cell apoptosis. The downstream genes and proteins of GSK-3beta(ser(9)) expression level decrease [2].
in vivo: The in vivo anti-leukemic activity of meisoindigo was also demonstrated by decreased spleen size in a dose-dependent manner [1]. Meisoindigo significantly inhibits the HT-29 xenograft tumors growth at the dose of 100 mg/kg.

in vitro: Cortisone suppressed this apoptosis at a concentration range of 1-10,000 ng/ml (2.8-28,000 nM) dose-dependently. Suppression of cortisol-induced apoptosis by cortisonewas consistently observed in PBMCs derived from 16 healthy subjects. Examination for inhibitory activities of the steroids against [3H]dexamethasone binding to PBMCs suggested that cortisone can bind cellular GC-receptors (GC-Rs), but the affinity of cortisone to GCRs is 1/30 or less than that of cortisol [1].  Apoptosis was also readily induced in primary cultures of third trimester decidual cells when treated with cortisol, cortisone, or dexamethasone (all 100 nM for 24 h) [2]. 
in vivo: The effects of a single dose of cortisone acetate (5 or 10 mg/100 g body weight) on B cells were examined in young chickens. A dose-dependent increase in numbers of circulating B lymphocytes and a change in their Ig-class distribution were followed by parallel increase in splenic plasma cells and serum immunoglobulins. The higher dose of cortisone produced changes in Bmu and Bgamma cells, whereas the lower dose primarily affected Bmu cells [3].  Adult female CD-1 mice received daily injections of cortisone acetate (0--50 mg/kg subcutaneously) and/or amphotericin B (0--12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) in a checkerboard combination dosage pattern for 30 days. Dosages of amphotericin B and cortisone acetate that produced little or no mortality individually produced significant (P less than 0.005) mortality in combination [4].

Target: antifungal
Flucytosine, or 5-fluorocytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine analogue, is a synthetic antimycotic drug. It is structurally related to the cytostatic fluorouracil and to floxuridine. It is available in oral and in some countries also in injectable form. A common brand name is Ancobon. Flucytosine was first synthesized in 1957 but its antifungal properties were discovered in 1964. The drug is dispensed in capsules of 250 mg and 500 mg strength. The injectable form is diluted in 250 mL saline solution to contain 2.5 g total (10 mg/mL). The solution is physically incompatible with other drugs including amphotericin B.
Flucytosine is well absorbed (75 to 90%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Intake with meals slows the absorption, but does not decrease the amount absorbed. Following an oral dose of 2 grams peak serum levels are reached after approximately 6 hours. The time to peak level decreases with continued therapy. After 4 days peak levels are measured after 2 hours. The drug is eliminated renally. In normal patients flucytosine has reportedly a half-life of 2.5 to 6 hours. In patients with impaired renal function higher serum levels are seen and the drug tends to cumulate in these patients. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine (90% of an oral dose) and only traces are metabolized and excreted in the feces. Therapeutic serum levels range from 25 to 100  g/ml. Serum levels in excess of 100 ug are associated with a higher incidence of side effects.

Target: Phosphodiesterase
Aminophylline is a compound of the bronchodilator theophylline with ethylenediamine in 2:1 ratio. The ethylenediamine improves solubility, and the aminophylline is usually found as a dihydrate. Aminophylline is less potent and shorter-acting than theophylline. Its most common use is in the treatment of airway obstruction from asthma or COPD. It is used off-label as a reversal agent during nuclear stress testing. Aminophylline is a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
Adenosine is an endogenous extracellular messenger that can regulate myocardial oxygen needs. It acts through cellular surface receptors which effect intracellular signalling pathways to increase coronary artery blood flow, slow heart rate, block atrioventricular node conduction, suppress cardiac automaticity, and decrease ¦Â-adrenergic effects on contractility. Adenosine also antagonizes chronotropic and ionotropic effects of circulating catecholamines. Overall, adenosine decreases the heart's rate and force of contraction, which increases blood supply to the cardiac muscle. Given specific circumstances this mechanism (which is intended to protect the heart) may cause atropine-resistant refractory bradyasystole. Adenosine's effects are concentration-dependent. Adenosine's receptors are competitively antagonized by methylxanthines such as aminophylline. Aminophylline competitively antagonizes the cardiac actions of adenosine at the cell surface receptors. Thus, it increases heart rate and contractility.",Ethylenediamine,O=C(N1C)N(C)C2=C(N=CN2)C1=O.O=C(N3C)N(C)C4=C(N=CN4)C3=O.NCCN,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Aminophylline.html

TMP caused induction of DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, ClpB, and IbpA/B Hsps. Among these Hsps, IbpA/B were most efficiently induced by TMP and coaggregated with the insoluble proteins [1]. Trimethoprim binds to dihydrofolate reductase and inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim's affinity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is several thousand times greater than its affinity for human dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase, an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway.

The increases of hepatic OA and betaine levels in OA feeding rats was also found when compared to the normal rats [3]. Feeding 1% OA with diet decreased the phosphorylation of AMPK and increased the maturation of SREBP-1 and the expression of SREBP-responsive genes in the rat liver.

Target: Antibacterial
Ethambutol dihydrochloride (Emb dihydrochloride) directly affects two polymers, arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in Mycobacterium smegmatis. In M. smegmatis, Ethambutol inhibits synthesis of arabinan completely and inhibits AG synthesis most likely as a consequence of this; more than 50% of the cell arabinan is released from the bacteria following Ethambutol treatment, whereas no galactan is released. Ethambutol main targets against embB gene product in M. avium. Ethambutol induces 60% changes in the embB gene in M. tuberculosis resistant mutants [1]. 
Ethambutol dihydrochloride (Emb dihydrochloride) is effective against actively growing microorganisms of the genus Mycobacterium, including M. tuberculosis. Nearly all strains of M. tuberculosis and M. kansasii as well as a number of strains of the M. aviumcomplex (MAC) are sensitive to Ethambutol. [1] 
Ethambutol dihydrochloride (Emb dihydrochloride) is potency against M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) with MIC of 0.5 ¦Ìg/mL in vitro [2]. Ethambutol is efficient on treatment of mycobacterial-infected macrophages.

Target: Others
Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid) is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NO2 and, depending on the definition used, one of the 20 to 80 essential human nutrients. Not enough niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. Chronic Niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra. The lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency disease which is caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins: niacin,vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D and vitamin A, and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition.
Niacin has been used for over 50 years to increase levels of HDL in the blood and has been found to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events modestly in a number of controlled human trials. Niacin cannot be directly converted to nicotinamide, but both compounds could be converted to and are precursors of NAD and NADP in vivo.Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and tryptophan (via quinoline acid) are co-factors for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. NADP and NAD are coenzyme for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis.High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency.",Free Acid,O=C(C1=CC=CN=C1)O,https://www.medchemexpress.com/Niacin.html

The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA.
In older literature, adenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4. It is no longer considered a true vitamin or part of the Vitamin B complex.

Glutamine (abbreviated as Gln or Q) is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code.

Its side-chain is an amide formed by replacing the side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group, making it the amide of glutamic acid. Its codons are CAA and CAG. In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid, with a concentration of about 500-900 ¦Ìmol/L.  
Glutamine is synthesized by the enzyme glutamine synthetase from glutamate and ammonia. The most relevant glutamine-producing tissue is the muscle mass, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lung and the brain. Although the liver is capable of relevant glutamine synthesis, its role in glutamine metabolism is more regulatory than producing, since the liver takes up large amounts of glutamine derived from the gut. The most eager consumers of glutamine are the cells of intestines, the kidney cells for the acid-base balance, activated immune cells, and manycancer cells.

L-Arginine is an ¦Á-amino acid. It was first isolated in 1886. The L-form is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids. At the level of molecular genetics, in the structure of the messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA, CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG, are the triplets of nucleotide bases or codons that code for arginine during protein synthesis. In mammals, arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual.
L-Arginine is associated with a decrease in cardiac index while stroke index is maintained in patients with severe sepsis. Resolution of shock at 72 hours is achieved by 40% and 24% of the patients in the L-Arginine and placebo cohorts, respectively. L-Arginine (450 mg/kg during a 15-minute period) amplifies and sustains the hyperemia (38%) and increases absolute brain blood flow after eNOS upregulation by chronic simvastatin treatment (2 mg/kg subcutaneously, daily for 14 days) in SV-129 mice.",Free Acid,N[C@@H](CCCNC(N)=N)C(O)=O,https://www.medchemexpress.com/l-arginine.html
